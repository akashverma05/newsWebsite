            <p>The priest, who has Greek nationality, was closing his church when the attack happened and is now in a
                serious condition.
                An attacker armed with a sawn-off shotgun on Saturday wounded a Greek Orthodox priest in a shooting in
                the French city of Lyon, a police source said.

                Nikolaos Kakavelaki, 52, was closing his church mid-afternoon when he was attacked and is now in a
                serious condition in hospital, said the source, who asked not to be named.
                The attacker fled the scene but later Lyon's public prosecutor Nicolas Jacquet announced that a suspect
                had been arrested.

            <p>
                “A person who could correspond to the description given by the initial witnesses has been placed in
                policy custody,” said Mr. Jacquet, adding that the suspect had not been carrying a weapon when he was
                arrested.

                The motive for the attack wasn't clear but it comes at a time when France is already on edge over the
                killing of three people inside church and the beheading of a teacher who showed a class a cartoon of the
                prophet Mohammed.

                The priest was shot twice in the chest at point-blank range, according to sources close to the enquiry.

                Witnesses heard the gunshots then “saw an individual fleeing and discovered a man with gunshot wounds at
                the back door of the church,” the Lyon prosecutor's office said in a statement.

                The interior ministry said that “security and emergency personnel are at the scene,” warning people to
                “avoid the area” where the attack took place. The search for the assailant was underway.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reacting to Saturday's attack, EU Parliament President David Sassoli said that “Europe will never bow to
                violence and terrorism”.

                The Assembly of Orthodox Bishops in France (AEOF) said it “condemned such acts of violence that threaten
                lives and spread a general climate of insecurity”.

                The small Orthodox church is situated in a residential area of Lyon which was especially quiet due to
                the new lockdown measures introduced in France on Friday to stem the growing coronavirus pandemic.

                In Paris, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin opened a crisis cell meeting to consider the situation.
                Prime Minister Jean Castex spoke of “the government's determination to allow each and everyone to
                practice their worship in complete safety and in complete freedom.”

                The shooting comes just days after three people were killed in a knife rampage inside a church in the
                southern town of Nice. A Tunisian suspect was shot by police near the scene of that attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                France has been on high alert since the January 2015 massacre at Charlie Hebdo marked the beginning of a
                wave of jihadist attacks that have killed more than 250 people.

                Tensions have heightened since last month, when the trial opened for 14 suspected accomplices in that
                attack.

                After the deadly attack in Nice, President Emmanuel Macron announced increased surveillance of churches
                by France's on-the-street military force, which is to be bolstered to 7,000 troops from 3,000.

                Security at schools will also be boosted, he said. Schools are remaining open during the new lockdown.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
