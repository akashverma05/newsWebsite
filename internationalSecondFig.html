            <p>The high number of early voters, about 65% of the total turnout in 2016, reflects intense interest in the
                contest, with three days of campaigning left.
                A record 90 million Americans have voted early in the U.S. presidential election, data on Saturday
                showed, as President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden campaigned across the country to
                try to sway the few remaining undecided voters.
                The high number of early voters, about 65% of the total turnout in 2016, reflects intense interest in
                the contest, with three days of campaigning left.

                Concerns about exposure to the coronavirus at busy Election Day voting places on Tuesday have also
                pushed up the numbers of people voting by mail or at early in-person polling sites.

            </p>
            <h5>Also Read: <a href="#"><span> Data shows a record number of mail votes may get rejected in 2020

            <p>
                Opinion polls show Mr. Trump trailing former Vice President Biden nationally, but with a closer contest
                in the most competitive states that will decide the election. Voters say the coronavirus is their top
                concern.

                Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed without evidence that mail-in ballots are susceptible to fraud and has
                more recently argued that only the results available on election night should count. In a flurry of
                legal motions, his campaign has sought to restrict absentee balloting.
                “I don’t care how hard Donald Trump tries. There’s nothing let me say that again there’s nothing that he
                can do to stop the people of this nation from voting in overwhelming numbers and taking back this
                democracy,” Mr. Biden said at a rally in Flint, Michigan, where he was joined by former President Barack
                Obama for their first 2020 campaign event together.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
