            <h6>UPDATED: OCTOBER 31, 2020 11:02 IST</h6>
            <h3>Mutation was seen in 78% of genomes sequenced from April 1 to May 18
            </h3>
            <img src="indexlatestfirst.jpg">
            <p>Mutation was seen in 78% of genomes sequenced from April 1 to May 18
                While novel coronavirus is undergoing many mutations, one particular mutation called D614G, according to
                a study, has become the dominant variant in the global COVID-19 pandemic.

                What is the D614G mutation?
                When the virus enters an individual’s body, it aims at creating copies of itself. When it makes an error
                in this copying process, we get a mutation.
                In this case, the virus replaced the aspartic acid (D) in the 614th position of the amino acid with
                glycine (G). Hence the mutation is called the D614G. This mutated form of the virus was first identified
                in China and then in Europe. Later it spread to other countries like the U.S. and Canada and was
                eventually reported in India.

            </p>

            <p>
                The D614G mutation is situated in the spike protein of the virus. “You can think of the spike protein as
                a massive ‘trimer’ assembly with three protein chains. Each protein chain has two sub-units (S1 and S2).
                The sub-unit S1 is the one that attaches to the host cells — Human ACE2 receptor,” says Dr. Lipi
                Thukral, Senior Scientist at CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) in an email to
                The Hindu.

                “The S2 sub-unit mediates the fusion of the viral and human membranes. The D614G mutation is present in
                the sub-unit S1 of the protein and is also close to the S2 sub-unit. Therefore, it has an impact on the
                human cell’s interactions with both S1 and S2,” she added.

                “In simple words, this particular mutation aids the virus in attaching more efficiently with the ACE2
                receptor in the human host, thereby making it more successful in entering a human body than its
                predecessors,” explains Dr. Saumitra Das, Director of the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics in
                West Bengal. To provide a clear picture of how transmissible this particular mutation of the virus has
                become over time, a paper in the journal Cell says that the mutation was found in 10% of 997 global
                genome sequences before March 1, 67% of sequences between March 1 and March 31 and 78% of the sequences
                between April 1 and May 18.
            </p>
            <p>
                A paper in the journal, Nature, after conducting experiments on hamsters, concluded that this particular
                mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and that
                the therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating variant of the virus before clinical
                development.

                “There is a need for extreme caution with premature inferences on mutations and their effects without
                supporting experimental evidence. This could result in a media frenzy and potentially undermine public
                confidence in vaccines,” Dr. Raghunathan states.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
