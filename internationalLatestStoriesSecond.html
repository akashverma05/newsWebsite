            <h6>UPDATED: OCTOBER 31, 2020 12:02 IST</h6>

            <p>All of France’s 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home at all times with no visitors, or
                risk steep fines or prosecution
                People in Paris fleeing for the countryside jammed the roads ahead of France’s lockdown to slow the
                spread of resurgent coronavirus infections, and there was only a sprinkling of people hurrying along
                city sidewalks Friday as the nationwide restrictions went into effect.
                Dystopian images of logjams that stretched for 435 miles (700 kilometers) at one point Thursday evening
                - exacerbated by the upcoming long holiday weekend - were a grim sign of a return to the dark days of
                the spring, when virus cases first swelled in Europe and many countries kept their citizens inside for
                weeks on end. With infections hitting record levels in some countries, many are now resorting to severe
                restrictions again.

                In France, concerns were growing that rising infections would swamp the country’s health system, so
                authorities ordered another four-week lockdown beginning Friday. Many areas of the French capital
                resembled a regular lazy weekend morning - on what would normally have been a bustling weekday. Those
                who were out frequently clutched permission forms proving they had an exemption that allowed them to to
                be on streets.

                The only places that were busy were grocery stores and markets as people stockpiled food and other
                necessities.

                All of France’s 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home at all times with no visitors, or
                risk steep fines or prosecution. There are a handful of exceptions, such as being allowed out for one
                hour of exercise a day within a half-mile (1 kilometer) of home, to go to medical appointments, to a
                place of work, or to shop for essential goods. Restaurants and cafşs are shuttered, apart from those
                that offer takeout.

                "Going to friends’ houses, having friends over and moving around for anything other than the reasons set
                out” will be impossible, Prime Minister Jean Castex explained firmly on Thursday.

                "It’s not nice because I left my country to enjoy the experience of living in another country,” said
                Laura Beimberg, 28, an intern at cosmetics giant L’Oreal who is from Mexico. “And this experience of
                being between four walls, far away from family and friends is so hard.”

                Carlo Ponti, a 54-year-old interior decorator, was among those who fled Paris, but he did it by train.
                He called the departure of the Parisians a “historic exodus.”

                "The minute the French president gave his speech (announcing a lockdown), the entire national train
                website went down, was overloaded. Everyone wanted to book to get away,” Ponti said.

                "During lockdown, the quality of life in the capital is terrible and so everyone who can do, tries to
                get away,” he said.

                The traffic was worsened by the fact that many were also leaving for the Nov. 1 All Saints’ Day holiday.

                Mr. Macron said that authorities would be “tolerant” about families returning from the holiday on
                Monday, but otherwise interregional travel is strictly prohibited.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
