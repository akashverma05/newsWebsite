            <h2>2,061 girls among 3,531 children adopted in 2019-20: Govt data</h2>
            <h4>PTI</h4>
            <h6>NEW DELHI, NOVEMBER 01, 2020 13:20 IST</h6>
            <h6>UPDATED: NOVEMBER 01, 2020 13:20 IST</h6>
            <h3>Within the country, 3,110 children were adopted while 421 inter-country adoptions took place in 2019-20.
            </h3>
            <img src="indexFirstPhoto.jpg">
            <p>A total of 3,531 children, including 2,061 girls, were adopted in India during the one year period ending
                March 31 with Maharashtra recording the highest number of adoptions among states, according to
                government data.

                As per data from the Child Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), 1,470 boys and 2,061 girls were adopted
                from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.

                In the context of widespread and generational preference for sons across cultures in the country, an
                official said people’s mindset is slowly changing and they are becoming more accepting towards adopting
                girls.

                “We give them three choices - one can opt for a girl, a boy, or can give no preference (while applying
                for adopting a child). Many people prefer to adopt a girl child,” he said.

                “There is a sense of collective wrong and guilt among some people who genuinely strive to redress it by
                adopting girls,” she said.

                According to the data, 3,120 children were adopted in the age group of 0-5 years while in the age group
                of 5-18 years as many as 411 children were adopted between April last year and March this year.

                The official said adoption of older children continues to be an issue as most parents still prefer to
                adopt children below two years of age.
            </p>

            <p>“People prefer to adopt younger children due to which it becomes more and more difficult to get a child
                adopted as he or she grows up,” he said.

                Mr. Sivadas said people might prefer younger children to experience the joy of parenting a child from
                the time it is born or soon after it is born.
                “However, we must recognize that adoption is not always done with the altruistic motive of giving the
                child a better life. As a result children with any kind of challenges including inter-sex children are
                rarely adopted,” she said.

                She further said “to what extent all this is reflecting changing values is yet to be established and
                only an in-depth study can resolve this matter with some degree of certainty and authority”.

                Within the country, 3,110 children were adopted while 421 inter-country adoptions took place in 2019-20,
                according to the data.

                Among states, the largest number of children were adopted from Maharashtra at 615 followed by Karnataka
                at 272, Tamil Nadu at 271, Uttar Pradesh at 261 and Odisha at 251.

                The official said generally Maharashtra has the highest number of adoptions because it has over 60
                adoption agencies while other states that are bigger have on an average 20 adoption agencies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The number of adoptions during 2019-20 is slightly lower than in 2018-19 when 3,745 children were
                adopted.

                The above data pertains to adoption of orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children and does not include
                children adopted from relatives or adoption of stepchildren.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
