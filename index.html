            <p>November 3 is the final day of voting for elections to the U.S. presidency, 35 seats in the 100-member
              U.S. Senate and the 435-member U.S. Congress, besides to the post of Governor in eleven States. Around 90
              million voters have already used the early in-person voting or the mail ballot option to register their
              mandate. This is nearly 64% of the overall turnout in the 2016 U.S. elections. Voter enthusiasm in 2020
              has led to one of the heaviest turnouts ever.</p>

          <h2>Spiral galaxy bars may prevent new stars</h2>
          <p>Stars are fundamental building blocks of galaxies and the seeds of these stars are clouds of cosmic dust
            and gas. Stars are scattered all around the galaxies, and the galaxies themselves are of different types:
            star-forming spiral galaxies and non-star-forming lenticular and elliptical galaxies. In some spiral
            galaxies, the stars move in elongated orbits near the centre so that, from far, this portion appears like an
            illuminated bar. Nearly two-thirds of the disc galaxies in the local universe are found to have this bar
            structure. “Stellar bars in galaxies are clearly visible in early images taken by photographic plates, and
            are known to exist in galaxies from early observations of galaxies,” says Koshy George from
            Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, Germany, who has recently co-authored a paper on barred galaxies.

          <p>FarmPal Technologi has made agriculture beneficial to growers and consumers during lockdown
            Growing up in a farming family in Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, Karan Hon has personally experienced the
            travails of Indian agriculture. “There was a lot of poverty in my village, because farmers used expensive
            traditional practices for cultivation, but never got the right price for their crop. There was no
            transparency in the wholesale market’s pricing. I found that disappointing,” says Hon over phone.</p>
