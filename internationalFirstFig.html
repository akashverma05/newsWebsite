            <h4>REUTERS</h4>
            <h6>REUTERSLONDON, NOVEMBER 01, 2020 01:03 IST</h6>

            <h3>Mr. Johnson said that the one-month lockdown across England would kick in at a minute past midnight on

            </h3>

            <p>Mr. Johnson said that the one-month lockdown across England would kick in at a minute past midnight on
                Thursday morning and last until December 2
                Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England back into a national lockdown after the United Kingdom
                passed the milestone of one million COVID-19 cases and a second wave of infections threatened to
                overwhelm the health service.
                The United Kingdom, which has the biggest official death toll in Europe from COVID-19, is grappling with
                more than 20,000 new coronavirus cases a day and scientists have warned the ”worst case” scenario of
                80,000 dead could be exceeded.
            </p>
            <h5>Also Read: <a href="#"><span>U.K. under pressure as COVID-19 epidemic doubling every 9 days</span></a>
            </h5>

            <p>
                Mr. Johnson, at a hastily convened news conference in Downing Street after news of a lockdown leaked to
                local media, said that the one-month lockdown across England would kick in at a minute past midnight on
                Thursday morning and last until December 2.

                In some of the most onerous restrictions in Britain's peacetime history, people will only be allowed to
                leave home for specific reasons such as education, work, exercise, shopping for essentials and medicines
                or caring for the vulnerable.

                “Now is the time to take action because there is no alternative,” Mr. Johnson said, flanked by his Chief
                Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and his Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Vallance.



                The government will revive its emergency coronavirus wage subsidy scheme to ensure workers who are
                temporarily laid off during a new England-wide lockdown receive 80% of their pay.
            </p>
            <h5>Also Read: <a href="#"><span> Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine shows positive results</span></a></h5>

            <p>

                Essential shops, schools, and universities will remain open, Mr. Johnson said. Pubs and restaurants
                willbe shut apart from for takeaways. All non-essential retail will close.

                Mr. Johnson's imposition of stricter curbs came after scientists warned the outbreak was going in
                the
                wrong direction and that action was needed to halt the spread of the virus if families were to have
                any
                hope of gathering at Christmas.

                Mr. Johnson was criticised by political opponents for moving too slowly into the first national
                lockdown, which stretched from March 23 to July 4. He fell ill with COVID-19 in late March and was
                hospitalised in early April.
                The measures bring England into alignment with France and Germany by imposing nationwide
                restrictions
                almost as severe as the ones that drove the global economy this year into its deepest recession in
                generations.

                So far the United Kingdom has reported 46,555 COVID-19 deaths - defined as those dying within 28
                days of
                a positive test. A broader death measure of those with COVID-19 on their death certificates gives
                the
                toll as 58,925.

                The United Kingdom has the world's fifth largest official death toll, after the United States,
                Brazil,
                India and Mexico, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
