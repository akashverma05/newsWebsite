            <p>“This is a huge success for the police and security forces. This is not a small achievement,” says IGP
                Vijay Kumar
                Hizbul Mujahideen’s chief operational commander Saifullah has been killed in an encounter at Rangreth
                area in Srinagar, IGP Kashmir Vijay Kumar said on November 1.
                “Saifullah had taken over the reins of the Hizb after the killing of its chief Reyaz Naikoo in an
                encounter in May,” IGP Kumar said.
                A suspect has been arrested at the encounter site and is being questioned, the police said.

                The gunfight had started on Nov. 1 afternoon as the security forces launched a search-and-cordon
                operation following a tip off about the presence of militants.

            <p>
                Saifullah, who had taken command of the outfit after the killing of Riyaz Naikoo in May this year, was
                one of the most wanted militants in the Kashmir Valley and involved in several attacks on the security
                forces, an official said.
                Addressing reporters near the encounter site, Mr. Kumar said they had received information that
                Saifullah had come here from south Kashmir and was hiding in a house.

                “So the security forces cordoned off the area and an operation was launched. In the exchange of firing,
                one militant was killed. According to our source, we are 95% sure he is Saifullah. We are retrieving the
                body and it will be identified,” Mr. Kumar added.

                “This is a huge success for the police and security forces. This is not a small achievement,” Mr. Kumar
                said.

                Incriminating material, including arms and ammunition, were recovered from the encounter site, he added.

                Mr. Kumar said the network of J&K Police has become stronger and police receive information about any
                militant entering the city.

                        <p>The DTC and Cluster buses resumed plying with full seating capacity on Sunday, with Transport
                            Minister Kailash Gahlot urging travellers to wear masks and observe COVID-19 appropriate
                            behaviour.

                            In a tweet, the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) said intra-state movement of buses has
                            been permitted with full seating capacity on a trial basis, subject to condition that no
                            passenger will travel standing and without mask.

                            Owing to closure of offices, the number of passengers who travelled on buses on Sunday was
                            relatively low.</p>
